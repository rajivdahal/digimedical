              It is said that Health is Wealth. So, to take care of our health,
              we need to consult a doctor once in a while for general health
              check-up, seasonal flu and fever, acute diseases, chronic illness
              and more. In many situations, we are physically weak and visiting
              a doctor in that condition seems like a difficult task. We’d
              prefer a doctor visiting us at our home for consultation rather
              than we having to visit them. Also, at the doctor’s clinic/
              hospital there are different kinds of patients which makes us even
              more vulnerable to other diseases. <br></br>
              To address the same need, Digi Medical has started to provide
              healthcare services at your home at reasonable costs compared to
              hospitals & nursing homes. The doctors making home visits are
              highly qualified and experienced professionals. They provide
              medical consultation and our Client Health Service Department will
              help you throughout your recovery process. Furthermore, by
              availing “Doctor at Home” service, you will be treated in the
