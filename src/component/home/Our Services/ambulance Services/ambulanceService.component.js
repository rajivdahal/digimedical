              Accidents can occur because of various reasons but it is essential
              to want a tailored way to limit such scenarios once this happens.

              vomiting, clumsiness, optical change, severe abdomen pain,
              bleeding profusely, wheezing of human blood, etc. In epidemic, in
              disaster and transfer of patient for hospital, post-surgical care
              also requires an ambulance. <br />

              This high-tech test is a key to diagnose and treat many health
              conditions that would otherwise remain hidden. While CT scans or
              digital X-rays produce two-dimensional images, Magnetic Resonance
              Imaging renders three-dimensional images or even slices of
              internal organs such as the brain or liver. You can book MRI/CT
