              Alternative medicine is a term that describes medical treatments
              that are used instead of mainstream therapies. Alternative
              medicine is defined loosely as a set of products, practices, and
              theories that are believed or perceived by their users to have the
              healing effects of medicine, but whose effectiveness has not been
              established using scientific methods.

              This is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that uses needles
              to stimulate specific points around the body. The person who
              performs this therapy (an acupuncturist) sticks thin, sterile
              needles into your skin. The goal is to help your body’s natural
              healing process kick in. Studies show that acupuncture can be
              effective in treating a number of conditions, like neck and back
              pain, nausea, anxiety, depression, insomnia, infertility, and many
              more.

            <p className="serv-text">
              It is an alternative medicine technique often used in conjunction
              with acupuncture. It is based on the concept of life energy which
              flows through "meridians" in the body. In treatment, physical
              pressure is applied to acupuncture points or ashi trigger points
              with the aim of clearing blockages in these meridians. Pressure
              may be applied by hand, by elbow, or with various devices. Some
              medical studies have suggested that acupressure may be effective
              at helping manage nausea and vomiting, low back pain, tension
              headaches, stomach ache and so on.

              Those who practice this alternative treatment believe it taps into
              the body's natural energy to speed healing. The practitioner
              hovers their hands over your body or places them lightly on your
              skin. The goal is to channel energy through their hands to your
              body to promote healing.

              Massage therapy is a practice that consists of Pressing, rubbing,
              and moving muscles and other soft tissues of the body, primarily
              by using the hands and fingers. The aim is to increase the flow of
              blood and oxygen to the massaged area. In massage therapy, a
              trained therapist applies pressure to the muscles and other soft
              tissues to help heal underlying conditions. Massage therapy can be
              used to address a number of different health problems, including
              sports injuries and chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, pre-
              or post-surgical treatment, excessive fluid build-up that often

              Yoga is practice or discipline of physical, mental, and spiritual

              Kundalini yoga is a form of yoga that involves chanting, singing,
              breathing exercises, and repetitive poses. Its purpose is to
              activate your Kundalini energy, or shakti. This is a spiritual
              energy that’s said to be located at the base of your spine. A
              typical Kundalini yoga class comprises three parts: an opening
              chant (known as “tuning in”) followed by a brief warm-up for your
              spine, a kriya (which is a sequence of postures paired with
              breathing techniques), and a closing meditation or song.
