              Physiotherapy, also referred to as physical therapy, is an allied
              health service that makes use of bio – mechanics or kinesiology,
              manual therapy, exercise therapy and electrotherapy to help
              patients restore, maintain and increase their physical mobility,
              strength and function.<br></br>
              <br></br>
              Physiotherapists are better able to help patients regain mobility,
              as they have a better understanding of how the body works and are
              trained in clinical skills to assess, diagnose and treat
              disabilities. Physiotherapists can help patients recover from
              injuries and disabilities ranging from back pain, neck pain, knees
              pain to ligament issues.<br></br>
              <br></br>
              Physiotherapy also helps in the rehabilitation of patients
              suffering from Parkinson’s, Paralysis, Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis
              and Cerebral Palsy. Furthermore, physiotherapists can heal both
              chronic and acute problems by treating patients at home.<br></br>
              <br></br>
              Digi Medical Physiotherapy at Home can help patients recover
              easily at the comfort of their home as the biggest problem for
              them is Mobility. Instead of travelling to a Physiotherapist,
              patient can get required attention and personalised care at home
              rapidly.
