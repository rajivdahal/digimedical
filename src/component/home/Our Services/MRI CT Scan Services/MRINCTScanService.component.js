              Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans may be carried out for a
              variety of reasons, and will be accordingly targeted at specific
              zones of the body. Scans of the brain and spinal cord, for
              instance, not only look for brain and spinal cord injuries but
              also for signs of blood vessel damage, cancer, multiple sclerosis
              and stroke. Scans of the bones and joints are also used to look
              for signs of cancer, as well as bone infections, joint damage and
              so on. Doctors may also carry out an MRI of the heart and blood
              vessels to look for blocked blood vessels and heart problems, such
              as damage or disease. A computerized tomography (CT) scan or
              computed tomography scan is a medical imaging technique used in
              radiology to get detailed images of the body noninvasively for
              diagnostic purposes.

              This high-tech test is a key to diagnose and treat many health
              conditions that would otherwise remain hidden. While CT scans or
              digital X-rays produce two-dimensional images, Magnetic Resonance
              Imaging renders three-dimensional images or even slices of
              internal organs such as the brain or liver. You can book MRI/CT
