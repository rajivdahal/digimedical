              Practicing good dental health is important to maintaining a
              healthy mouth, teeth and gums. It will also help your appearance
              and quality of life. Diseased, crooked or missing teeth or a
              misshapen jaw can interfere with your speech; Cavities are painful
              places on your teeth where decay has eaten through the enamel and
              exposed a tooth's root. Hot or cold food or liquids can send a
              painful signal that something is wrong. Cavity may not have any
              symptoms until after significant damage to the tooth. This is why
              regular visits to your dental professional are so important. Early
              signs of tooth decay are easier to treat than advanced cases.
