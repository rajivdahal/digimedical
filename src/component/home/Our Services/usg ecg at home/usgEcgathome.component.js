              Ultrasonography (USG)/ultrasound is a procedure that uses
              high-energy sound waves to look at tissues and organs inside the
              body. The sound waves make echoes that form pictures of the
              tissues and organs on a computer screen (sonogram).
              Ultrasonography is used to help diagnose diseases.

              An electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical signals in your
              heart. An echocardiogram (ECHO) is a test that uses high frequency
              sound waves (ultrasound) to make pictures of your heart. The test
              is also called echocardiography or diagnostic cardiac ultrasound.

              Your doctor may use an echo test to look at your heart’s structure
